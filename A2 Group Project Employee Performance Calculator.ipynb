    "# Clothing Boutique Retail Store - Employee Performance Calculator\n",
    "# Project Overview:\n",
    "# This programme is designed for a boutique clothing store that wants a simple, data-driven way to evaluate the performance of its sales associates \n",
    " \n",
    "# The programme is designed to collect 3 key performance metrics (KPIs) for each employee:\n",
    "# 1. Weekly Sales (£)\n",
    "# 2. Hours Worked \n",
    "# 3. Customer Service Rating (1-5)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using these metrics, the programme calculates an overall performance score for each employee and will assign them to a performance category, and then the programme will print a clear summary report for the store manager\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why this is helpful for a clothing Retail Store:\n",
    "# Clothing retail relies heavily on strong customer service, selling ability and productivity during shifts. This tool will help a Clothing Retail Store to:\n",
    "# - identify top-performing sales associates \n",
    "# - support employees who may need additional coaching \n",
    "# - understand sales efficiency (sales compared to hours) \n",
    "# - keep evaluations consistent, unbiased and data-based\n",
    "\n",
    "# Python Requirements Demonstrated in This Programme: \n",
    "# 1. Collecting and processing user input (employee metrics)\n",
    "# 2. Using at least one function (performance score calculation)\n",
    "# 3. Using a loop to enter multiple employees\n",
    "# 4. Using conditionals to assign performance categories \n",
    "# 5. Using a list + dictionaries to store employee records \n",
    "# 6. Producing meaningful output (a structured performance summary)\n",
    "\n",
    "# This project demonstrates our ability to core Python principles to a realistic retail business scenario in a simple and effective way"

    "\n",
    "employees = [] # created an empty list that will store all employee dictionaries\n",
    "SALES_WEIGHT = 0.5 # sales contribute positively to performance \n",
    "RATING_WEIGHT = 20 # strong customer service rating boosts score \n",
    "HOURS_PENALTY = 0.1 # more hours worked slightly reduces efficiency \n",
    "\n",
    "# In this cell, we set up the main data structure that will store all employee information for a Clothing Retail Store\n",
    "# We are using a LIST to store multiple employees because:\n",
    "# - The number of employees entered will vary (dynamic)\n",
    "# - A list will allow us to easily loop through all employees later \n",
    "\n",
    "# Each employee will be stored as a DICTIONARY. A dictionary is perfect because it lets us store the data as 'key value pairs' such as:\n",
    "# \"name\": employee name\n",
    "# \"sales\": weekly sales \n",
    "# \"hours\": hours worked \n",
    "# \"rating\": customer service score (calculated later)\n",
    "# \"score\": final performance label (assigned later)\n",
    "\n",
    "# So the structure will look like this: \n",
    "# employees = [\n",
    "#    {\"name\": \"...\", \"sales\": ..., \"hours\": ..., \"rating\": ..., \"score\": ..., \"category\": \"...\"},\n",
    "#    {\"name\": \"...\", ...},\n",

    "# In retail, managers often want to recognise top performers for rewards, bonuses, scheduling advantages, or training opportunities. So automating this process makes the evaluation process more objective and more consistent\n",
    "\n",
    "# How do we find the top performer:\n",
    "# - each employee in the 'employees' list is stored as a dictionary\n",
    "# - each dictionary contains a 'score' key (calculated earlier)\n",
    "# - we use Python's built-in max() function to scan the entire list and return the employee dictionary with the highest 'score'\n",
    "\n",
    "# Understanding the lambda function:\n",
    "# max(employees, key=lambda x: x[\"score\"])\n",
    "# - 'lambda x: x[\"score\"]' tells Python HOW to compare employees\n",
    "# - Instead of comparing whole dictionaries, Python compares ONLY the 'score' value inside each dictionary \n",
    "# - This is a common and powerful technique for working with lists of more complex data structures \n",
    "\n",
    "# Before running the enhancement we check whether the 'employees' list acutally contains data. If the input loop (Cell 4) hasn't been run yet, this prevents the programme from crashing "
