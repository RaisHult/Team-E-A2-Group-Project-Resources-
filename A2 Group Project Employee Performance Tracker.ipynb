    "# Clothing Boutique Retail Store - Employee Performance Calculator\n",
    "# Project Overview:\n",
    "# This programme is designed for a boutique clothing store that wants a simple, data-driven way to evaluate the performance of its sales associates\n",
    "\n",
    "# The programme is designed to collect 3 key performance metrics (KPIs) for each employee:\n",
    "# 1. Weekly Sales (£)\n",
    "# 2. Hours Worked\n",
    "# 3. Customer Service Rating (1-5)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using these metrics, the programme calculates an overall performance score for each employee and will assign them to a performance category, and then the programme will print a clear summary report for the store manager\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why this is helpful for a clothing Retail Store:\n",
    "# Clothing retail relies heavily on strong customer service, selling ability and productivity during shifts. This tool will help a Clothing Retail Store to:\n",
    "# - identify top-performing sales associates\n",
    "# - support employees who may need additional coaching\n",
    "# - understand sales efficiency (sales compared to hours)\n",
    "# - keep evaluations consistent, unbiased and data-based\n",
    "\n",
    "# Python Requirements Demonstrated in This Programme:\n",
    "# 1. Collecting and processing user input (employee metrics)\n",
    "# 2. Using at least one function (performance score calculation)\n",
    "# 3. Using a loop to enter multiple employees\n",
    "# 4. Using conditionals to assign performance categories\n",
    "# 5. Using a list + dictionaries to store employee records\n",
    "# 6. Producing meaningful output (a structured performance summary)\n",
    "\n",
    "# This project demonstrates our ability to core Python principles to a realistic retail business scenario in a simple and effective way"

    "HOURS_PENALTY = 0.1 # more hours worked slightly reduces efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "# In this cell, we set up the main data structure that will store all employee information for a Clothing Retail Store\n",
    "# We are using a LIST to store multiple employees because:\n",
    "# - The number of employees entered will vary (dynamic)\n",
    "# - A list will allow us to easily loop through all employees later\n",
    "\n",
    "# Each employee will be stored as a DICTIONARY. A dictionary is perfect because it lets us store the data as 'key value pairs' such as:\n",
    "# \"name\": employee name\n",
    "# \"sales\": weekly sales\n",
    "# \"hours\": hours worked\n",
    "# \"rating\": customer service score (calculated later)\n",
    "# \"score\": final performance label (assigned later)\n",
